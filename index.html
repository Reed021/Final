        This summer I picked up gardening as my other hobby, and it compliments
        my cooking well! In the picture on the left you'll see a raised garden.
        this summer I grew tomatoes, basil, garlic, lavendar, oregano, chives,
        sage, marigolds, and mint. This year was very rainy so my tomatoes didnt
        come out well. Yet, all my other spices did fantastic! I cant wait to
        get my garden ready for the next spring. I actually purposefully grew
        spices that have synergies with eacother. Basil, chives, and marigolds
        work in harmony to prevent pests from eating the tomatoes. Marigolds
        smell unplesant to bugs, chives are unplesant smelling to deer, and
        basil serves as defense for the tomatoes because bugs will eat it before
        the tomatoes.

        Cooking is one of my favorite hobbies. My suitemates are blessed with
        delicious food nearly every night due to my hobby. My family has always
        been big on cooking with my father teaching me simple chicken cutlets
        and pasta at a young age. However my passion of cooking has been mostly
        self developed in the last year with my father having gone to florida
        when i was 16.

        My name is <em>Connor Reed</em>. Im currently a student at Southern
        Connecticut State University. My major is Interdisciplinary studies
        where I combine 3 minors into a major. I chose Computer Science,
        History, and Managent. Together they each have a roll in building my IDS
        major.

        In highschool I had to run my father's carwash, and I learned that I
        love to find unique solutions to complicated problems. However more
        importantly I learned the best way to manage others is to divide and
        conquer, giving each teammate a role they enjoy and take pride in doing.
        I strongly belive a workplace should thrive to grow a strong team who
        support one another.

        At Southern Connecticut State University I met my girlfriend, Luisa, in
        the picture on the right we were at cape cod for vacation. She also
        shares my love of tacobell and baja blast. She is going to SCSU to
        become a speech language pathologist (For those of us who dont speak
        medical lingo, she is a speech therapist). Luisa is Italian and lives in
        the Bronx, NYC. Despite this, I am the chef of the relationship,
        although I am also Italian. Speaking of cooking. Cooking is one of my
        favorite hobbies. My suitemates are blessed with delicious food nearly
        every night due to my hobby. My cousin who also goes to SCSU has tried
        to come over the last 3 nights because I invited her over for dinner
        once and now Connecticut hall isnt good enough for her tastes. I
        reluctantly havent had left overs for the last week.
