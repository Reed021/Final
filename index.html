            As of this moment, I'm currently halfway through my senior semester
            at SCSU. I entered the school as a freshman and was undecided on my
            major until the end of freshman year when I declared my interest in 
            pursuing a Computer Science Degree. My sophomore year was a sign that I
            needed to change things; my grades dipped as I realized that I loved
            the software aspects of Comp Sci, yet my hardware classes were a
            different story. Many of the elements of hardware were not only
            difficult for me to wrap my head around, but the way and the speed at
            which they were taught made it even more challenging. At the end of
            my Sophomore year, I consulted my advisors about my dilemma, having
            exhausted my efforts of constantly playing catch-up in my hardware
            classes. 
          </summary>
          <p>
              At the end of my Sophomore year, I consulted my advisors about my dilemma, and with the help of my advisors, I determined that while my computer science skills are useful, they could be used towards a bigger purpose. The abstract thinking of computer science is my favorite part and my biggest consideration when I decided to pair Computer Science with Management and history in an Interdisciplinary (IDS) major. Each of these topics serves its own purpose in the type of work I plan to pursue with these skills.

            My Favorite hobby is cooking. It can be stressful, but the results
            of a good meal are always worth the stress. Furthermore, it's a
            hobby that can be shared with your loved ones.

            Gardening is a solo hobby of mine. It can take a long time to see
            the results of gardening, but watching plants grow is satisfying
            beyond belief. It's great to enjoy the fruits of your labor,
            especially when you know how to cook!

            Our class was instructed to use Java classes to simplify a class
            schedule. However, labs and other courses had specific parameters
            that would extend beyond the typical definition of a class that
            needed to be implemented.

            This project was my final for my Spring 2024 Java class. We had to
            build a maze game that used a limited UI to steer around and find
            parts to build a machine. It was challenging to have limited UI in
            the design process.
